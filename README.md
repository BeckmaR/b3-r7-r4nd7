# b3-r7-r4nd7
Contribution to the get-in-it.de [coding challenge](https://www.get-in-it.de/coding-challenge).
The objective: Find the shortest path through an undirected graph of nodes (representing planets) from node "Erde" to node "b3-r7-r4nd7".

Uses the [Dijkstra-algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find the shortest path. Written in pure python3.

Main script: `shuttle.py`
Graph implementation: `graph.py`
Tests: `test.py`
